REQUIREMENTS (that I can think of right now)
* PG ADMIN 4
* PSQL
* [OPTIONAL] Postgres GUI Editor ("Azure Data Studio" from Microsoft is my personal pick, makes life a lot simpler if you want to visualize the data outside of flask.)

**The following works in Unix based operating systems, not sure if it works in Windows, if there are any issues with Windows let me know and I'll look into it**

*Step 1*
Make sure you have the PGAdmin4 application and install psql in your command line, start your server on local host, then run the command:
psql postgres

Followed by:
postgres# CREATE DATABASE F1_DB;

** OR **

Use a GUI to run the command:
CREATE DATABASE F1_DB;

*Step 2*
Once you intialize the PostgreSQL DB, insert the file containing all ERGAST information using the following command:
psql F1_DB < F1_DB.pgsql


Once again if you have any issues let me know and I can help out.
